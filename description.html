    <h1 class="heading">UNIVERSE - The Biggest Mystery!</h1>
    <p>Universe, the never ending question! The more you get involved in this the more you get froze in it.This 13.7 billion years old domain is a headache to many.Dark matter, Black holes, Supernova, Nebula and manymore. everything is jsut a question mark to us..!<br>But first let us look at what actually the universe is in consonance with Science.</p>
    <p>The universe is literally everything, the sum of all existence. It includes all matter, like stars and galaxies. The universe also includes all radiation and all other forms of energy. No matter where or when you exist, you are a part of the universe, as is everything you experience. There is nothing outside the universe, because anything that exists is automatically included in the definition of the universe.</p>

    <p>How did the universe come to be?

    It is perhaps the greatest Great Mystery, and the root of all the others. Humanity's grandest questions — How did life begin? What is consciousness? What is dark matter, dark energy, gravity? — stem from it</p>
    <p>Our best understanding of the history of the universe comes from the Big Bang theory. Observations of distant galaxies reveal that all galaxies are, on average, moving away from every other galaxy. Astronomers interpret this motion to mean that the universe itself is expanding; on the very largest scales, the distances between galaxies grow with time. This means that in the past, the universe was smaller, hotter and denser than it is today.

     Einstein's theory of general relativity allows cosmologists to connect the contents of the universe to its expansion history and, from there, calculate its age. According to current estimates, based on a wide variety of observations — such as distant supernovas(opens in new tab), the cosmic microwave background(opens in new tab) and the abundance of light elements — the universe is approximately 13.787 billion years old. In its earliest moments, the entire universe was compressed into an infinitely tiny point known as the singularity. From that singularity, space expanded, giving rise to the universe that we see today, according to NASA(opens in new tab).</p>
    <!-- COSMOS -->
    <div class="cosmic">

    <h1 class="heading">Our Cosmic Universe</h1>
    <p>The universe is more than just stars, dust, and empty space. it's full of cosmos(larger and more complex system)somewhere beyond our imagination.</p>

    <img class="cosmos" src="images/cosmos.jpg" alt="">
    <img class="cosmos2" src="images/cosmos2.jpg" alt="">

    <p>Astronomers often talk about “the observable Universe” which is essentially what we can see – the solar system, local stars a few light years/parsecs away, to nearby galaxies some millions of light years/parsecs away to the edge of the visible Universe some 13.6 billion light years distant. Modern astronomy has revealed a great deal about the observable Universe which is generally accepted to have begun via the hot big bang some 13.6 billion years ago.
The Universe then expanded and cooled, allowing the formation of atoms prior to the first stars being formed which re-ionised the Universe. At this “epoch of reionisation” galaxy formation was well underway. Since that time the Universe has been evolving through the merging of proto-galaxies to form larger and larger galaxies, like the Milky Way. Matter in the universe appears to be dominated by an as yet unknown form of dark matter.
Observations of distant type Ia supernovae, combined with high spatial observations of the cosmic background radiation suggest that the Universe has a density close to, if not exactly equal to critical density required to make spacetime flat. As well the universe appears to be undergoing a period of accelerated expansion, driven by dark energy either as a cosmological constant or variable vacuum energy called quintessence.
The large-scale structure of the Universe can be described as filamentary, and cosmological N-body simulations produced by theoretical astronomers agree well with the observed structure as revealed by surveys such as the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
“Other Universes” refers to Universes which may exist but have no effect on us. Philosophers and relativists ponder whether other Universes might exist, e.g. multiverses, and if black holes might lead to them.</p>

 <!-- BLACK HOLES -->
  <h1 class="heading">BLACK HOLES</h1>
    <p>Don't let the name fool you: a black hole is anything but empty space. Rather, it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of New York City. The result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. In recent years, NASA instruments have painted a new picture of these strange objects that are, to many, the most fascinating objects in space.<br />The idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light could not escape it has been around for centuries. Most famously, black holes were predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, which showed that when a massive star dies, it leaves behind a small, dense remnant core. If the core's mass is more than about three times the mass of the Sun, the equations showed, the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole.</p>
    <h1 class="sub-heading">One Star's End is a Black Hole's Beginning</h1>
    <p>Most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion. (Smaller stars become dense neutron stars, which are not massive enough to trap light.) If the total mass of the star is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun), it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity. However, as the star collapses, a strange thing occurs. As the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the "event horizon," time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away. When the surface reaches the event horizon, time stands still, and the star can collapse no more - it is a frozen collapsing object.</p>

     <!-- SUPERNOVA -->
     <div class="supernova">
    <h1 class="heading" >Supernova</h1>
    <p>It is the biggest explosion that humans have ever seen. Each blast is the extremely bright, super-powerful explosion of a star.A supernova is the name given to the cataclysmic explosion of a massive star at the end of its life. It can emit more energy in a few seconds than our sun will radiate in its lifetime of billions of years.The sky above us is strewn with alluringly beautiful remnants of ancient supernovae, that is, stars that lived out their lives and then died in these violent explosions. In a galaxy like our Milky Way, consisting of some 200 billion stars, there should be a supernova as often as every 50 years. </p>
    <div class ="container">
      <img class="super" src="images/supernova img.jpg">
      <p>A supernova is what happens when a star has reached the end of its life and explodes in a brilliant burst of light. Supernovae can briefly outshine entire galaxies(opens in new tab) and radiate more energy than our sun(opens in new tab) will in its entire lifetime. They're also the primary source of heavy elements in the universe. According to NASA, supernovae are "the largest explosion that takes place in space.<br>When the pressure drops low enough in a massive star, gravity suddenly takes over and the star collapses in just seconds. This collapse produces the explosion we call a supernova."</p>
      <img class="nova" src="images/supernova1.jpg" alt="">
      <p>A star is in balance between two opposite forces. The star’s gravity tries to squeeze the star into the smallest, tightest ball possible. But the nuclear fuel burning in the star’s core creates strong outward pressure. This outward push resists the inward squeeze of gravity.
When a massive star runs out of fuel, it cools off. This causes the pressure to drop. Gravity wins out, and the star suddenly collapses. Imagine something one million times the mass of Earth collapsing in 15 seconds! The collapse happens so quickly that it creates enormous shock waves that cause the outer part of the star to explode!”
That resulting explosion is a supernova.</p>

    <!-- NEBULA -->
   <h1 class="heading">Nebula</h1>
   <p>A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. Some nebulae (more than one nebula) come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion of a dying star, such as a supernova. Other nebulae are regions where new stars are beginning to form. For this reason, some nebulae are called "star nurseries."Nebulae are made of dust and gases—mostly hydrogen and helium. The dust and gases in a nebula are very spread out, but gravity can slowly begin to pull together clumps of dust and gas. As these clumps get bigger and bigger, their gravity gets stronger and stronger.Eventually, the clump of dust and gas gets so big that it collapses from its own gravity. The collapse causes the material at the center of the cloud to heat up-and this hot core is the beginning of a star.</p>
   <div class="nebula">
     <h2>Where are nebulae?</h2>
     <img class="nebula-img" src="images/nebula.jpg" alt="">
     <p>Nebulae exist in the space between the stars—also known as interstellar space. The closest known nebula to Earth is called the Helix Nebula. It is the remnant of a dying star—possibly one like the Sun. It is approximately 700 light-years away from Earth. That means even if you could travel at the speed of light, it would still take you 700 years to get there!</p>

 <!-- DARK MATTER -->
  </div>
  <div class="dark-matter">
    <h1 class ="dark">DARK MATTER</h1>
    <div class="dark-content">
      <p class="matter-content">In the early 1990s, one thing was fairly certain about the expansion of the universe. It might have enough energy density to stop its expansion and recollapse, it might have so little energy density that it would never stop expanding, but gravity was certain to slow the expansion as time went on. Granted, the slowing had not been observed, but, theoretically, the universe had to slow. The universe is full of matter and the attractive force of gravity pulls all matter together. Then came 1998 and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of very distant supernovae that showed that, a long time ago, the universe was actually expanding more slowly than it is today. So the expansion of the universe has not been slowing due to gravity, as everyone thought, it has been accelerating. No one expected this, no one knew how to explain it. But something was causing it.
      Eventually theorists came up with three sorts of explanations. Maybe it was a result of a long-discarded version of Einstein's theory of gravity, one that contained what was called a "cosmological constant." Maybe there was some strange kind of energy-fluid that filled space. Maybe there is something wrong with Einstein's theory of gravity and a new theory could include some kind of field that creates this cosmic acceleration. Theorists still don't know what the correct explanation is, but they have given the solution a name. It is called dark energy.</p>
      <h1 class="energy">What is Dark Energy ?</h1>
    <img class="dark-energy-img" src="images/dark energy.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="matter-content">More is unknown than is known. We know how much dark energy there is because we know how it affects the universe's expansion. Other than that, it is a complete mystery. But it is an important mystery. It turns out that roughly 68% of the universe is dark energy. Dark matter makes up about 27%. The rest - everything on Earth, everything ever observed with all of our instruments, all normal matter - adds up to less than 5% of the universe. Come to think of it, maybe it shouldn't be called "normal" matter at all, since it is such a small fraction of the universe.One explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space. Albert Einstein was the first person to realize that empty space is not nothing. Space has amazing properties, many of which are just beginning to be understood. The first property that Einstein discovered is that it is possible for more space to come into existence. Then one version of Einstein's gravity theory, the version that contains a cosmological constant, makes a second prediction: "empty space" can possess its own energy. Because this energy is a property of space itself, it would not be diluted as space expands. As more space comes into existence, more of this energy-of-space would appear. As a result, this form of energy would cause the universe to expand faster and faster. Unfortunately, no one understands why the cosmological constant should even be there, much less why it would have exactly the right value to cause the observed acceleration of the universe. </p>
   <h1>What is Dark Matter ?</h1>
   <img class = "matter-img" src="images/matter-img.jpg" alt="">
   <p class="matter-content">By fitting a theoretical model of the composition of the universe to the combined set of cosmological observations, scientists have come up with the composition that we described above, ~68% dark energy, ~27% dark matter, ~5% normal matter. What is dark matter?

We are much more certain what dark matter is not than we are what it is. First, it is dark, meaning that it is not in the form of stars and planets that we see. Observations show that there is far too little visible matter in the universe to make up the 27% required by the observations. Second, it is not in the form of dark clouds of normal matter, matter made up of particles called baryons. We know this because we would be able to detect baryonic clouds by their absorption of radiation passing through them. Third, dark matter is not antimatter, because we do not see the unique gamma rays that are produced when antimatter annihilates with matter. Finally, we can rule out large galaxy-sized black holes on the basis of how many gravitational lenses we see. High concentrations of matter bend light passing near them from objects further away, but we do not see enough lensing events to suggest that such objects to make up the required 25% dark matter contribution.</p>
